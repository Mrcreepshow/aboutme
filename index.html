      Welcome to my personal archive/digital junk drawer ! My name is Claire, and I am a multimedia artist with a focus on tech art. I am currently based in Chicago, working and pursuing a BFA in studio at SAIC. I am interested in exploring the complexity of the discomfort of life, edging boundaries of what leaves myself and others unsettled.
